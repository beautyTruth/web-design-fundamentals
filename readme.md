## Repo accompanying the Completion of CSS Fundamentals Section of Jonas Schmedtman's Web Design Course



## Just for reps using command line and git commands

### It's really not a big deal

## I'm also getting practice doing markup

### As you can see here

## You would really like Jonas's courses

He doesn't teach [Markdown]().

```
```

### But he teaches you how to be self sufficient

## So that you can look it up and learn on your own

```
```

Note: The `license` noted at the bottom is something I'm putting there as a default; `:user` and `:repo` are normal attributes you would include in a readme if you were doing this properly.
